II. Design
-----------
1. Login Page--- Once the application is started, the user will be greeted with a login page. This login page will display two options: Sign-In and Sign-Up. The Sign-In option is for those who have already created an account with the system. The Sing-Up option is available to those who do not already have an account for the application. They will be able to make an acount with this option. If the correct credentials are put in, then the user will be able to enter the homepage.
2. Homepage--- The login page will lead to this page. The homepage is main page of this application. From here, the user will be able to start their project. The user will be able to create tasks for their project.
